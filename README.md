## UpSet Diagram

According to [Caleydo](https://github.com/Caleydo); UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections.
UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. (more info [here](https://caleydo.org/tools/upset/))

Here is an image from UpSet tool from Caleydo:

## Goal
For our Bioinformatics project, we decided to use data visualization methods which are very popular in these days. When searching the alternative diagrams, came across with [Caleydo](https://github.com/Caleydo)'s UpSet. 
We tried to create an "alike" UpSet diagram working with the same logic by using JavaScript.

## 
### There are 4 different clusters.

### By look at the circles, you can understand which/how many clusters in intersection and value of these intersections.

`This diagram, which we cannot find a similar one in the internet, may be useful and open to development.`
